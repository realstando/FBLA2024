Create a website for your school’s guidance department so students can easily search job
 postings and employers can easily submit them.
 Your website must include the following functionalities:
 • A page for employers to submit postings
 • A backend panel to approve or delete postings
 • A page displaying the approved postings
 • A page for students to apply for the posting
